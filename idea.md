You're correct to reconsider the flow based on the user's demand, especially since the user might want to upload their own background image and banner, which adds a layer of customization. Let's refine the workflow to accommodate this scenario, leveraging your available models effectively. The goal is to generate a text-rich image first, then use the Vision LLM to place the banner, create a video prompt, and finally produce the output. Here's how we can do this in multiple ways:
Revised Workflow Based on User Demand
User Demand
The user can either upload a background image or provide a description for generating one.
The user can also upload a banner or provide details for generating one.
The final output should be a video with the banner placed on the background image, animated according to the user's vision.
Possible Workflows
Workflow 1: User Uploads Background Image and Banner
User Input:
User uploads a background image (e.g., a coastal scene).
User uploads a banner (e.g., a text-rich image with "ALOYA" and a call-to-action button).
Vision LLM Analysis:
The Vision LLM analyzes the background image to understand its content, layout, and suitable areas for banner placement.
It also analyzes the banner to ensure it fits aesthetically with the background.
Banner Placement:
GPT-4.1 generates instructions for placing the banner on the background image. For example:
"Place the banner at the top center of the background image, ensuring it does not obscure key elements like the ocean or horizon."
The Vision LLM or an image editing model (e.g., GPT-1 and Flux Context Max) executes these instructions to composite the banner onto the background image.
Video Prompt Generation:
GPT-4.1 generates a video prompt based on the composited image. For example:
"Animate the scene with the background image moving slightly to the left, keeping the banner fixed in place, add subtle motion blur to the background to emphasize movement, ensure the text in the banner remains legible."
This prompt is passed to the Image-to-Video Generator Model.
Video Generation:
The Image-to-Video Generator Model creates the final video animation based on the prompt.
The output is a video with the banner fixed on the moving background image.
Final Output:
The video is delivered to the user.
Workflow 2: User Provides Description for Background and Banner
User Input:
User describes the background (e.g., "a coastal road with an ocean view").
User describes the banner (e.g., "a text-rich banner with 'ALOYA' and a 'Explore Sandrail R1' button").
Background Image Generation:
GPT-4.1 refines the background description into a detailed prompt for Ideogram v3 or GPT-1. For example:
"Generate a high-resolution image of a coastal road with an ocean view, motion blur in the background, aspect ratio 16:9, styled raw."
Ideogram v3 or GPT-1 generates the background image.
Banner Generation:
GPT-4.1 refines the banner description into a prompt for Ideogram v3 or GPT-1. For example:
"Generate a text-rich banner with 'ALOYA' prominently displayed at the top, a call-to-action button 'Explore Sandrail R1', modern design, transparent background."
Ideogram v3 or GPT-1 generates the banner image.
Vision LLM Analysis:
The Vision LLM analyzes both the background image and the banner to determine the best placement and aesthetic integration.
Banner Placement:
GPT-4.1 generates instructions for placing the banner on the background image, similar to Workflow 1.
The Vision LLM or image editing models composite the banner onto the background image.
Video Prompt Generation:
GPT-4.1 generates a video prompt based on the composited image, similar to Workflow 1.
Video Generation:
The Image-to-Video Generator Model creates the final video animation.
Final Output:
The video is delivered to the user.
Workflow 3: Hybrid Approach (User Uploads Background, Generates Banner)
User Input:
User uploads a background image.
User describes the banner (e.g., "a text-rich banner with 'ALOYA' and a 'Explore Sandrail R1' button").
Banner Generation:
Follow the banner generation steps from Workflow 2.
Vision LLM Analysis and Banner Placement:
Follow the analysis and placement steps from Workflow 1.
Video Prompt Generation and Video Generation:
Follow the steps from Workflow 1 or 2, depending on the desired animation.
Final Output:
The video is delivered to the user.

Visual Representation (Conceptual)
Start with "User Input" at the top.
Draw arrows to "GPT-4.1" for refining both background and banner prompts.
From "GPT-4.1," draw arrows to "Ideogram v3/GPT-1" for generating both the background image and the banner.
Draw an arrow from both outputs to "Vision LLM" for analysis.
From "Vision LLM," draw an arrow to "GPT-4.1" for banner placement instructions.
Draw an arrow to "GPT-1 & Flux Context Max" for compositing the images.
Draw an arrow to "GPT-4.1" again for generating the video prompt.
Finally, draw an arrow to "Image-to-Video Generator Model" and then to "Final Output."
Why This Flow is Good
Ideogram v3's Strength: Since Ideogram v3 is best for generating text-rich images, starting with it for both the background and banner ensures high-quality, detailed outputs.
Vision LLM's Role: The Vision LLM is crucial for understanding the images and guiding the placement and animation, ensuring aesthetic and functional integration.
Iterative Refinement: The use of GPT-4.1 for multiple stages allows for iterative refinement, which is key to achieving the desired result.
Flexibility: This flow accommodates both user-uploaded content and generated content, making it versatile for different user needs.
